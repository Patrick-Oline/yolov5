The dataset includes 92 images.
Street-Signs are annotated in YOLOv5 Oriented Object Detection format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:

The following transformations were applied to the bounding boxes of each image:
* Random rotation of between -25 and +25 degrees
* Random shear of between -15째 to +15째 horizontally and -15째 to +15째 vertically
